/**
 * "Indirect" vs "Direct" Function Execution - Summary
It can be confusing to see that there seem to be two ways of executing a function:

function add() {
  something = someNum + someOtherNum;
}
add() vs add

It's important to understand why we have these "two ways"!

In general, you call a function that you defined by using its name (e.g. add) and adding parentheses (with any parameters the function might need - or empty parentheses if no parameters are required like in the above example).

=> add()

This is how you execute a function from your code. Whenever JavaScript encounters this statement, it goes ahead and runs the code in the function. Period!

Sometimes however, you don't want to execute the function immediately. You rather want to "tell JavaScript" that it should execute a certain function at some point in the future (e.g. when some event occurs).

That's when you don't directly call the function but when you instead just provide JavaScript with the name of the function.

=> someButton.addEventListener('click', add);

This snippet would tell JavaScript: "Hey, when the button is clicked, go ahead and execute add.".

someButton.addEventListener('click', add()); would be wrong.

Why? Because JavaScript would encounter that line when it parses/ executes your script and register the event listener AND immediately execute add - because you added parentheses => That means (see above): "Please execute that function!".

Just writing add somewhere in your code would do nothing by the way:

let someVar = 5;
add
alert('Do something else...');
Why?

Because you just throw the name of the function in there but you don't give any other information to JavaScript. It basically doesn't know what to do with that name ("Should I run that when a click occurs? After a certain amount of time? I don't know...") and hence JavaScript kind of ignores this statement.

The key difference between add() and add in JavaScript lies in how functions are referenced and executed.

1. add() (Function Execution)
When you write add(), you are calling or invoking the function add.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
function add() {
  console.log("Function is executed");
}
add(); // This executes the function
Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Function is executed
In this case, the function is executed immediately, and its code runs.

2. add (Function Reference)
When you write add without parentheses, you are referencing the function itself, not executing it. You are treating the function as a value.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
function add() {
  console.log("Function is executed");
}
console.log(add); // Logs the function itself
Output:

sql
Copy code
[Function: add]
Here, add is simply the reference to the function definition. You can use it for things like:

Assigning the function to a variable
Passing it as a callback
Returning it from another function
Example of Passing a Function Reference:
javascript
Copy code
function add() {
  console.log("Function is executed");
}

function callFunction(fn) {
  fn(); // Executes the passed function
}

callFunction(add); // Passing the function reference
Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Function is executed
Key Points:
add(): Executes the function immediately.
add: Refers to the function without executing it.
Practical Example to Show the Difference:
javascript
Copy code
function add() {
  console.log("Function is executed");
}

console.log(add);   // Logs the function reference
add();              // Executes the function
Output:

csharp
Copy code
[Function: add]  // Reference
Function is executed  // Execution


**===============================================================================
const defaultResult = 0;
let currentResult = defaultResult;

function add() {
currentResult = currentResult + userInput. value;
outputResult(currentResult, calculationDescription) ;

}

addBtn. addEventListener('click', add); but here it is executing function on click

In the code snippet you provided:

javascript
Copy code
addBtn.addEventListener('click', add);
The function add is being passed as a reference to the addEventListener method. It does not execute immediately when the script runs. Instead, it executes only when the click event occurs.

Why add Doesn't Execute Immediately
If you write add() inside the addEventListener, the function will execute immediately as soon as the script runs because of the parentheses ().
Example (incorrect if you want a delay):

javascript
Copy code
addBtn.addEventListener('click', add()); // This executes add immediately!
However, in your case:

javascript
Copy code
addBtn.addEventListener('click', add);
Here:

add is passed as a reference to the click event handler.
The browser waits for the click event to occur and then calls the add function.
How Event Listeners Work
When you pass add without parentheses, you're telling JavaScript:

"Here is the function I want you to run when the event occurs."

JavaScript doesn't run the function immediately. It simply remembers the function (add) and executes it when the event (click) happens.

Example for Clarity:
Using Function Reference (Correct):

javascript
Copy code
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

button.addEventListener('click', sayHello);
sayHello is passed as a reference.
The function executes only when the button is clicked.
Using Function Execution (Incorrect):

javascript
Copy code
button.addEventListener('click', sayHello());
sayHello() executes immediately during the script run.
The return value of sayHello() (which is undefined) gets passed to the event listener.
Why Your Code Works Correctly
javascript
Copy code
addBtn.addEventListener('click', add);
You are passing the function add as a reference.
The browser waits for the user to click the button.
When the click happens, the add function is executed.
Summary:
add: Function reference â€” passed as a callback to addEventListener. It executes on the event.
add(): Executes immediately when the script runs and does not wait for the event.
